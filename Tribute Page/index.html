        <h3>Here's a timeline of Madan Kumar Bhandari life in A.D.:</h3>
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span>Life </span> - Madan Bhandari was born in the Dhungesangu village of Taplejung district in a Brahmin 
              family in eastern Nepal in 27 June 1951. He studied at Medibung School in Taplejung and in Varanasi, India. In 1972,
               he became a central committee member of the Janabadi Sanskritik Morcha (Democratic Cultural Front), 
               a student movement established by Pushpa Lal Shrestha. Around 1976 he left Pushpa Lal's Communist Party of 
               Nepal to create the Mukti Morcha Samuha ("Liberation Front Group"), which formed an alliance with
                the survivors of the Jhapa Movement in 1978. He was a founding member of the Communist Party of Nepal
                 (Marxist-Leninist) preceding the 1980
               referendum and was elected General-Secretary at its Fourth National Congress in 1986.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1991 election and aftermath</span> -The CPN (UML), under the leadership of Bhandari, 
              won all but one seat in the Himalayan capital in the 1991 elections, the country's first free
               election after more than three decades. Bhandari proclaimed this "a vote for democracy," 
               "a vote for independence" and "a vote for the alleviation of poverty."
               He argued for the popular vote as opposed to armed struggle as the main tactic for communists.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Personal life</span> -Bhandari married with Bidya Devi Bhandari in 1982. 
              Mrs. Bhandari at the time of her marriage was a prominent student leader. 
              After the marriage, however, she preferred staying in the backgrounds since 
              Madan Bhandari was in the top echelon of party leadership.
               Mrs. Bhandari reentered politics after her husband’s death and was later elected for four terms as
                the Member of Parliament, oversaw major Cabinet portfolios and went on to become the 
                first woman President of Nepal, remaining in the highest office for seven years and four months.
               The couple had two daughters, Usha Kiran Bhandari and Nisha Kusum Bhandari. Both daughters are married.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Death</span> - On May 16, 1993 Bhandari died in a car accident in Dasdhunga, Chitwan.
               According to an investigation led by K.P. Oli, it was not an accident but an unsolved murder.
                Of the three people inside the car, only the driver Amar Lama survived who was later abducted and 
                killed by a group of unidentified gunmen in Kirtipur, Kathmandu;
               the two leaders Madan Bhandari and Jibaraj Ashrit died.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Aftermath</span> -A bust has been built at the spot of the accident at Dasdhunga.
               The government of Nepal proposed to build Madan Bhandari Highway from Shantinagar of
                Jhapa district to Rupal of Dadheldhura district. In March 2018, Madan Bhandari Museum was
                 inaugurated in Urlabari, Morang.
               The damaged jeep of the 1993 accident has been kept on display at the Urlabari Museum.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Awards</span> -On 2016, he was posthumously awarded with Nepal Ratna Man Padavi, 
              the highest honour to a Nepali citizen by the Government of Nepal.
